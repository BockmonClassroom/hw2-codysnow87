Homework 2 - Data Collection  
Due 1/24/2025

Answer the following (20 points):
1. Explain your data collection process.
I used two succulents and one spider plant in my living room window. Using Google search, I did my best to identify the species of each plant. I then set about measuring the leaves and collecting the measurements in my .csv file. In the case of both Chlorophytum Comosum and Sedum Astrid, I have multiple specimens from which I took measurements. I only have one Echeveria Pulidonis. Each plant was measured in turn. I selected the leaves mainly based on accessibility of the leaf, as the succulents are quite delicate (several leaves were lost in the process). I rounded the values from my micrometer to the nearest 0.1 mm. 

2. What instrument did you use to collect data with?
I used two--for the length of the spider plant's long leaves, I used a metal 30cm ruler. For the widths of all the leaves and the lengths of the succulents, I used a Neiko sub-millimeter-accuracy digital micrometer. 

3. Argue the accuracy and precision of your instrument.
For the ruler, my data gathering was prone to some level of error (probably 5 or so mm). I flattened the leaves along the length of the ruler and did my best to see where the tip landed. 

The micrometer is much more accurate, to within 0.1 mm. In addition, the measurement process of using the caliper on the micrometer makes the measurement easier to dial in and then collect, given the digital screen with a readout that holds the measurement. 

4. How many data points did you collect? Why?
I collected 20 for each plant species. I know Iris has 50, and I originally intended to collect this number per species, but the tediousness of the process was very high. Also, I ran out of leaves with my two small spider plants, and so I just collected 20 each for the other two plants afterward. 

5. Define the size of your data in terms of both N (full data set size) and n (each subset size).
N = 60
n = 20

6. Explain any problems that you ran into during the data collection process.
At first, I tried to remember which leaves I measured, but I kept losing track. Eventually, I resorted to marking a dot on the measured leaves with a sharpie. The process was surprisingly tedious and time consuming. I had to make a decision about where to measure the leaves--essentially deciding, for each leaf, what the "base" of the leaf is. Getting the instrument into the tight spaces around the delicate leaves was the most tedious part of all. 

Analysis/Visualization - (50 points)
Now that you have collected the data you will now need to analyze and visualize the data.
Complete the following:
1. Graph histograms of your data with appropriate labels.
2. Graph boxplots of your data with appropriate labels.
3. Graph a scatter plot of your entire data set with each subset different color and a ledger.
4. Explain each graph in terms of variance, mean, median, and standard deviation.
5. What can you infer with data and graphs that you have?
